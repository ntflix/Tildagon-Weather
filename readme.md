# Tildagon EMF Weather

Very crude example of using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) on a Tildagon and displaying the results.

The app needs a couple of seconds to start up as Wi-Fi is initialised.

Wi-Fi sometimes does not work and can occasionally fail silently.

A file called `api_key.txt` with your [__free OpenWeather API key__](https://openweathermap.org/api) in it is needed.
